## About

Asynchronous programming is a fundamental skill for modern software development. This repository provides hands-on exercises to help you understand and master:

- Callbacks and callback patterns
- Promises and promise chains
- Async/await syntax
- Error handling in asynchronous code
- Concurrent task execution
- Real-world async patterns

## Getting Started

### JavaScript Exercises

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

Setup:
```bash
cd javascript
npm install
```

Running exercises:
```bash
node exercises/exercise1-callbacks.js
```

### Python Exercises

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip

Setup:
```bash
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running exercises:
```bash
python exercises/exercise1_asyncio_basics.py
```

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise includes:
- **Problem statement**: What you need to implement
- **Starting code**: A template to get you started
- **Solution**: Reference implementation (in `solutions/` directory)
- **Tests**: Automated tests to verify your solution

## JavaScript Exercises

1. **Exercise 1: Callbacks** - Learn callback patterns and handling asynchronous operations
2. **Exercise 2: Promises** - Convert callbacks to promises and chain promise operations
3. **Exercise 3: Async/Await** - Use modern async/await syntax for cleaner async code
4. **Exercise 4: Error Handling** - Properly handle errors in asynchronous code

## Python Exercises

1. **Exercise 1: asyncio Basics** - Introduction to asyncio and coroutines
2. **Exercise 2: Async Functions** - Create and use async functions
3. **Exercise 3: Concurrent Tasks** - Run multiple tasks concurrently
4. **Exercise 4: Error Handling** - Handle exceptions in async code
