# JavaScript Asynchronous Exercises

This directory contains exercises for learning asynchronous JavaScript programming.

## Setup

Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher).

```bash
npm install
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Callbacks
**File**: `exercises/exercise1-callbacks.js`

Learn the fundamentals of callback-based asynchronous programming. You'll implement functions that use callbacks to handle async operations.

**Run**: `node exercises/exercise1-callbacks.js`

**Topics**:
- Callback functions
- Error-first callbacks
- Callback chaining

### Exercise 2: Promises
**File**: `exercises/exercise2-promises.js`

Convert callback-based code to Promises and learn how to chain promise operations.

**Run**: `node exercises/exercise2-promises.js`

**Topics**:
- Creating Promises
- Promise chaining with `.then()`
- Error handling with `.catch()`

### Exercise 3: Async/Await
**File**: `exercises/exercise3-async-await.js`

Use modern async/await syntax for writing cleaner asynchronous code.

**Run**: `node exercises/exercise3-async-await.js`

**Topics**:
- `async` functions
- `await` keyword
- `Promise.all()` for concurrent operations
- Try/catch error handling

### Exercise 4: Error Handling
**File**: `exercises/exercise4-error-handling.js`

Master error handling patterns in asynchronous JavaScript.

**Run**: `node exercises/exercise4-error-handling.js`

**Topics**:
- Try/catch with async/await
- Error handling in promise chains
- Retry logic
- `Promise.allSettled()`
