// Promise.all – Fail Fast Behavior

// Create 3 Promises:

// p1 resolves "User data" after 1s

// p2 rejects "Auth failed" after 2s

// p3 resolves "Settings loaded" after 3s

// Task:

// Use Promise.all() and explain:

// What happens?

// Does p3 still run?

// Which value is returned?

// 📌 Goal: Understand fail-fast behavior.
